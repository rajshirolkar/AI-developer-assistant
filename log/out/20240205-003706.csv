<starlette.requests.Request object at 0x0000029AC24D0110>,        test,What would you like to test?,2,"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While the response does ask for clarification on what is being tested, it does not provide any relevant information or context. It fails to address the question prompt or provide a coherent response.","The user prompt lacks specificity and guidance, leading to an incoherent response. A more coherent question could be: ""Can you provide an example of a software or system that you would like to test, and outline the specific objectives or challenges you anticipate in the testing process?"" This revised prompt provides clear direction and encourages the respondent to provide a coherent and relevant answer.",3,"The text provided has a fair structure and flow, but there are some noticeable issues in logic and consistency that hinder understanding. Although the response starts by asking for clarification on what needs to be tested, it doesn't follow through with any specific ideas or arguments related to testing. The lack of a clear direction or focus makes it challenging to understand the purpose or intention behind the response. Additionally, the response doesn't address the question asked, which further contributes to the low coherence score.",
