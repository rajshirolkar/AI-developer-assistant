<starlette.requests.Request object at 0x000002E1354F3F50>,        what is the key,"I'm sorry, your question is not clear. Could you please provide more context or specify what key you are referring to?",5,"The answer has perfect coherency. While the question is vague and lacks specificity, the answer effectively 
addresses the ambiguity by requesting more context or clarification. It acknowledges the lack of clarity in the 
question and provides a clear and coherent response, demonstrating an understanding of the need for additional 
information.","To elicit a coherent response, the question should be more specific and provide enough context for the respondent to understand what is being asked. For example: ""What is the key role of communication in building successful relationships?"" or ""What is the key ingredient for a successful recipe?"" By adding specificity and context, the question will guide the respondent to provide a more focused and coherent answer.",4,"I have assigned a coherence score of 4 to this response because it effectively addresses the lack of clarity in the question and provides a clear explanation of the issue. The response shows logical flow by acknowledging the unclear question and then asking for more context or specification. It also demonstrates relevance by directly referring to the specific key the question is asking about. The response is concise and to the point, without any contradictory or unrelated statements. Although there is a minor logical gap in the response (i.e., not providing an immediate answer), it is understandable given the lack of clarity in the question. Overall, the response is well-structured and demonstrates good coherence.",
